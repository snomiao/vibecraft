# VibeCraft

![](assets/readme/vibecraft-workspace-example.png)

**An RTS-style workspace for managing AI coding agents.**

VibeCraft turns your local coding workflow into a visual strategy game: agents, folders, terminals, and browsers all live on one shared canvas.

## What You Can Do

- Spawn Claude and Codex agents as units
- Attach agents to project folders and run tasks in context
- Open terminals for each agent and workspace
- Keep multiple projects visible in one place
- Use built-in git worktree actions from folder entities

## The RTS Paradigm

VibeCraft is easiest to use when you think of it like a strategy game.

### Entities on the Canvas

- **Hero**: your command center
- **Agents**: Claude/Codex units that execute coding tasks
- **Folders**: project entities that agents can attach to
- **Browser panels**: embedded web views for docs/tools
- **Terminal panels**: terminal sessions for agents and workspace workflows

### The Canvas

The main workspace is an infinite, pannable canvas.

- **Pan** to navigate large workspaces
- **Zoom** to switch between overview and detail
- **Select** any entity to see its details and actions
- **Move** entities to organize your layout

### HUD: Details + Abilities

When you select an entity, the HUD shows:

- **Details**: current state and context for that entity
- **Abilities**: actions you can perform right now

Examples:

- Select an **agent** to attach/detach, open terminal, clear history, or destroy
- Select a **folder** to rename, remove/trash, or run git worktree actions
- Select a **browser/terminal panel** to refresh/restart/close

### Agent Status Colors

- **Gray**: idle
- **Yellow**: starting
- **Green**: online
- **Orange**: stopping
- **Red**: error

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher
- Bun (recommended)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Optional: Claude Code CLI and/or Codex CLI for agent workflows

## Run Locally

### Bun (recommended)

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Other package managers

```bash
# npm
npm install
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## First 5 Minutes

1. Launch the app and create or open a workspace.
2. Add a folder/project to the canvas.
3. Spawn a Claude or Codex agent.
4. Attach the agent to a folder.
5. Open the agent terminal and start prompting.

## Controls at a Glance

- Left click: select entity
- Left drag: move selected entity
- Shift + drag (or middle mouse drag): pan canvas
- Scroll/pinch: zoom
- Click empty space: clear selection

## Example Workflows

### 1) Parallel feature work

- Create two agents
- Attach each one to a different project folder
- Run two tasks in parallel while keeping both terminals visible

### 2) Worktree-based changes

- Use folder git worktree actions to create/sync/merge worktrees
- Keep source and worktree folders side by side on the canvas
- Move agents between folders depending on what needs attention

### 3) Build + docs loop

- Keep your app terminal open in one panel
- Keep docs/reference open in a browser panel
- Use an attached agent to apply and iterate changes quickly
